# ESP32-holder-with-power-supply
A 3d design to hold the esp32 board and a power supply for it. Made by Fukuro#9999 (big thank you to LittleNyanCat#3801 for helping me figure out the circuit) for LucidVR open source project. 
If you want to support me  :3 - https://ko-fi.com/fykuro
You can find pics of it here as well ^

Feel free to use/edit the design. You are not allowed to sell it without my permission. 
Lucas, if you are reading this, you are an exeption for this rule. If you end up using it, it would be an honor, thank you for bringing together such a nice community and creating a big brain solution for vr gloves. :D
I linked some of the parts you need, you can use any buttons, but you might have to change dimentions. Most of them are easy to change if you go to parameters. I use Fusion360.
Components list:
1 - button (to check the battery charge)
1 - switch (power on/off)
1 - 5V 1S powerbank module https://www.amazon.com/DAOKI-Battery-Charging-Protection-Lithium/dp/B082144XKS
1 - 3.7 Li-ion 18650 battery (I use 3000mAh)
1 - holder for said battery (You have to make two holes in the side of the holder for wires) https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-10pcs-Battery-Holder-Storage/dp/B00LSG5BKO
1 - Li-Ion 1S charge indicator (CHOOSE 1S) https://www.amazon.com/DAOKI-Capacity-Indicator-Sections-Electric/dp/B07YKGHVSV
1 - ESP32
2-4 - M2 screws (to hold down esp. You need at least 2.)
A bunch of wire to connect everything together

WARNING 
I haven't fully tested it yet. I've connected all the power related circutry, but not the wires from the glove itself. Imma do that soon, but for now just keep in mind that this is 
still a prototype. 

Welp, that's about it. Have fun :D
